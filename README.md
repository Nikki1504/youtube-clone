### 📌 Disclaimer

This project is built for educational and portfolio purposes only.

## ⚠️ Search Suggestions Note

The search suggestions feature uses Google's `suggestqueries` API.

This API does **not support CORS**, so search suggestions work in local development but may be blocked in production deployments (e.g. Vercel over HTTPS).

In a real-world production setup, this would be handled via:

- A backend proxy / serverless function
- Or a custom suggestion service

The core search flow and video fetching functionality remain fully functional.
